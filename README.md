# Advanced-Bindings for JavaFX (8)

**advanced-bindings** is a collection of useful helpers and custom binding implementations to simplify the 
development of applications that are heavily based on JavaFX's Properties
and Bindings. 

The first goal for this project it to create custom bindings for the (all) methods of `java.lang.Math`.
